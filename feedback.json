    "raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"clarity\": \"Low. The candidate's response is disorganized, rambling, and contains grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand her points.  Many sentences are incomplete or nonsensical.\",\n  \"confidence\": \"Medium. While the candidate expresses enthusiasm and eagerness, her delivery lacks polish and professionalism.  She mentions being confident but the overall presentation contradicts that.\",\n  \"technical_accuracy\": \"Low.  Mentioning 'Alak with B-Jango' suggests unfamiliarity with standard technical terminology (likely meant Flask/Django). The lack of clarity makes it hard to assess her actual technical skills.\",\n  \"communication_skills\": \"Low.  Poor grammar, unclear articulation, and a rambling delivery significantly detract from effective communication. The interview responses lack structure and conciseness.\",\n  \"overall_feedback\": \"The candidate demonstrates enthusiasm and a desire to learn, but her poor communication skills, lack of clarity, and potential inaccuracies in technical terminology are significant weaknesses.  She needs to significantly improve her communication skills, practice structuring her answers, and ensure accurate technical vocabulary. The self-assessment provided at the end by the 'interviewer' suggests a casual and unprofessional interview setting which does not reflect real-world scenarios.\"\n}\n```\n"
